1. TripSheet deletion fixes : Go back to old route
2. Hardcoded company address to be fetched from Supabase
3. If deliveries > capacity how to portray to user
4. If first 24 addresses routed, how to do next lot
5. Map view fixes
6. Group multiple deliveries together

-> so we need to format the trip sheet in standard print format the florists are used to already.
